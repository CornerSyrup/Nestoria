> _"A place for every photo, comic, and digital memory—explore, flatten, and discover your collections in a new light."_

Welcome to **Nestoria**! This app was created out of a love for organizing digital memories and for building a unique way to navigate collections. Made with ❤️ as a personal side project, Nestoria is here to help you uncover layers of photos, comics, or other images with joy and ease.

Whether you're a comic lover, a photo collector, or just looking for a beautiful way to organize memories, **Nestoria** brings a new perspective to exploring your digital world.

## 🎨 Why Nestoria?

Nestoria is designed for those who love exploring and organizing in their own way. It's perfect if you:

- Want to view **all** your images—even those hidden in subfolders—in a single, seamless experience.
- Enjoy having control over how you view your collections.
- Appreciate a simple, lightweight tool that adds a bit of magic to browsing your files.

Nestoria started as a personal tool, a “for-me” project to browse through my own collections. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Nestoria is simple and ready to go. To start exploring:

1. **Open Nestoria** in your favorite web browser.
2. **Choose Your Collection**: Upload a folder of images or comics directly to view.
3. **Customize and Explore**: Toggle views, filter contents, and dive into your folders however you like.

Nestoria is designed to be a lightweight, enjoyable tool. Just bring your collections and let the exploration begin! 😊

## 📖 Usage

- **Folder Structure**: Treat each folder as a potential "Gallery" and each file as a "Piece". Nestoria can display your collection in layers, or "flatten" it to see everything at once.
- **Filter Settings**: Adjust your settings to show or hide specific folders, making it easy to focus on just what you want.
- **Themes and Layouts** (Coming Soon!): Look forward to more options for customizing the appearance of your gallery.
